Revenue comes from student tuition, fundraising and donations, revenue from medical centers, government support, and returns that come from the endowment. Columbia sets itself apart in the combination it uses--a much bigger percentage of its operating budget comes from student tuition dollars, as opposed to donations or returns from its endowment."
