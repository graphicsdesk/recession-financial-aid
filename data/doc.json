          "But <c>Columbia</c> sets itself apart, growing more expensive at a rate far beyond the average private college.",
          "Both Columbia’s tuition and total cost of attendance is the highest among <v>all Ivy League schools</v>, and are now the most expensive in the nation. But despite huge hikes in tuition, 10 percent less Columbia College students receive financial aid today than they did 30 years ago, and socioeconomic diversity has stagnated over the last ten.",
          "Columbia’s structure relies more on full-paying student tuition dollars than its peers, has taken on large capital projects to stay competitive with top schools, and has placed fundraising for financial aid on the back burner. Does increasing access among low and middle income students fit into the budget?"

Revenue comes from student tuition, fundraising and donations, revenue from medical centers, government support, and returns that come from the endowment. Columbia sets itself apart in the combination it uses--a much bigger percentage of its operating budget comes from student tuition dollars, as opposed to donations or returns from its endowment."
